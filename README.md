This is early days. I'm learning how to code, and i love roguelikes. So as a result here's this. I'm starting from scratch, I'm writing it in Python 2.7, and not looking to any other code for solutions (except the game loop which i lifted from somewhere, but plan to rewrite once i know more about what i'm doing).

Controls:
Up, Down, Left, Right - Move
Esc - Quit

To install:
No such thing. You'll need Python and Pygame. To run navigate to wherever you extract this file and type python GameLoop.py. There's not much at this point.
